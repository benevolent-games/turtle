*slow and steady static site generator*

- turtle is a one-line command that generates a website
- you write html templates in plain javascript
- templates are just async functions, so you can do *anything*
- you can kind of imagine it like some kind of static javascript "php"
- turtle also copies other files like css and whatnot
- turtle has proper typescript typings

<br/>

## turtle turtorial

note, turtle doesn't care whether you use typescript or plain javascript, but in the examples here i'll be using the two interchangeably.

<br/>

### generate a website with turtle's cli

```sh
npx @benev/turtle --in="s/demo:x/demo" --out="x/demo" --exclude="**/*.partial.html.js" --verbose="true"
```

<br/>

### ask turtle for help

```sh
npx @benev/turtle --help
```

<br/>

### write your first webpage template, like `index.html.js`

turtle will sniff out your `.html.js` files, and render them into html pages.

```js
import {template, html} from "@benev/turtle"
const {url} = import.meta

export default template(async({path}) => html`
  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>@benev/turtle</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="${path(url).version.root('style.css')}"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>@benev/turtle</h1>
    </body>
  </html>
`)
```

<br/>

### you can write template partials

it can accept a context object

you tell turtle to ignore it with `--exclude="**/*.partial.html.js"`

`page.partial.html.ts`

```ts
import {template, html} from "@benev/turtle"
const {url} = import.meta

export default template(async({path}, x: number) => html`
  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8"/>
      <title>@benev/turtle - stamp test</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="${path(url).version.root('style.css')}"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>@benev/turtle - stamp test</h1>
      <p>${x}</p>
    </body>
  </html>
`)
```

<br/>

### write your first turtle script, like `stamp.turtle.js`

turtle also sniffs out `.turtle.js` scripts and executes them.

in these, you can do anything you want. your turtle script function is provided some handy stuff like the `write_webpage` function.

`stamp.turtle.ts`

```ts
import {turtle_script} from "@benev/turtle"

// import the partial from the previous example
import page from "./page.partial.html.js"

// we'll stamp out a webpage for each of these values
const values = [1, 2]

// your default export must be a turtle_script
export default turtle_script(async({write_webpage}) => {

  // loop over each value
  await Promise.all(values.map(async(x) => {

    // write a webpage
    await write_webpage({

      // provide the page template
      template: page,

      // provide the x value in the context
      context: x,

      // specify the destination relative
      // to this build script
      destination: `${x}.html`,
    })
  }))
})
```

<br/>

### you've gotta get into *file path hash versioning!*
- that's what the above example is doing with that `path` function
- if you use `.version` then it will attach the file's hash as a suffix
- so `/style.css` becomes `/style.css?v=c252882f`
- now when you deploy your site, your users won't see old cached css files that break your website -- now the browser cache becomes *version aware!* ü§Ø

<br/>

### use `path` in your templates

turtle gives you a `path` utility that allows you to link to file from different reference points. it can also do *file path hash versioning* for you.

to understand it, consider a hypothetical file structure like this:

```
s/ <-- (source directory)
  favicon.png
  cool/
    awesome.html.ts <-- (your turtle template)
    style.css
```
also, we'll assume you've set `const {url} = import.meta`

- `path(url).root("favicon.png")`  
  use *root* to reference files relative to the website root.  
  result: `../favicon.png`

- `path(url).local("style.css")`  
  use *local* to reference files relative to the current template module.  
  result: `style.css`

- `path(url).dest("rofl.jpg")`
  use *dest* for special cases, to reference files relative to the *destination html file* that it output.  
  this is for custom turtle script builds, where the destination html file output will be written into a different directory structure than the location of the current template module.  

okay, this might make more sense when you consider file path versioning.

simply add `.version` to the above commands, and turtle will attach a hash query param suffix, which will magically fix all your browser caching problems:

- `path(url).version.root("favicon.png")`  
  result: `../favicon.png?v=f6dd3bc1`

- `path(url).version.local("style.css")`  
  result: `style.css?v=ce5f3acd`

- `path(url).version.dest("rofl.jpg")`  

<br/>

### remember, the templates are just async js functions
- so you can import other modules, read and write files, whatever you want
- thanks to top-level await, you could have a module read yaml files or whatever, and then templates can import that data

<br/>

### be sure to escape globs

- if you provide a glob to a flag like `--exclude="partials/**/*"` -- be sure to use double quotes so that your shell doesn't expand the glob -- the double quotes tells your shell to pass the literal glob to turtle, which will then process the glob properly (if you let the shell expand the glob, it won't work)
